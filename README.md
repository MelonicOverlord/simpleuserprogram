# simpleuserprogram
A Simple Program That Allows You To Enter A Name And Get Different Outputs. This Is Being Updated Regularly So Expect To See Lots Of New Outcomes! The Original Version Added Here Is Version 0.9 - The Other Versions Were Early Stages And I Don't Even Have The Files Anymore. Please Remember To Add Variables Where There Is Writing Telling You To, Otherwise You Will Just Get Outputs Such As "Is Your Name putanamehere". Please DM Me On Discord (MelonicOverlord#6655) If You Have Any Questions Or Requests.

LATEST VERSION: v0.9 -------- CODE LICENCE - ODbL-1.0
